## 📖 More about dplyr and ggplot

Last week we discussed the basics of dplyr. This week you'll learn about the 
__Grammar of Graphics__ and its central idea: a graphic involves mapping data to geometric 
objects and their visual attributes. This is the underlying framework behind the 
mechanics and core functions available in “ggplot2” for creating simple graphics:

- Begin your graphic specification with `ggplot()`
- Indicate where the `data` comes from
- Establish which variables are going to be mapped into visual attributes: `aes()`
- Decide what kind of geometric object(s) will be used to display data; e.g. `geom_point()`
- Optional: do you need to use __facets__?
- Optional: do you need to explicitly use one or more statistical __transformations__?
- Optional: do you need to explicitly set a non-default system of __coordinates__?
- Optional: do you need to explicitly use a non-default __theme of graphical elements__?

In addition, we introduce so-called pipelines and the use of the pipe operators `|>` and `%>%`.

## 🎯 Objectives

At the end of this week you will be able to:

- Get a first contact with `"ggplot2"`
- Describe the purpose of the aesthetic mapping function `aes()`
- Describe the notion of "layers" and how to use them for making a graphic using `"ggplot2"`
