title: "12) Bindings and Environments"

## ðŸ“– Names, Values and Environments

This week we go down a technical rabbit hole to learn three important concepts. 
First, we discuss how R differentiates between __names and values__. Second, 
we talk about the so-called __copy-on-modify__ policy which is what R uses 
to decide when a copy of an object needs to be made. And third, we briefly 
review __environments__ which are basically the data structure that powers scoping. 
Understanding all these notions will be helpful in our last week when we get to 
talk about performance and memory usage of R code.
