title: "2) Vectors and Factors"

## ðŸ“– Vectors and Factors

In this module we describe data types and their implementation in R objects like 
__vectors__ and their cousins __factors__. We'll focus on important concepts like:

- vectors and their data types (e.g. logical, integer, double or real, and character).

- __creation of vectors__: various ways and functions to create vectors.

- __implicit coercion__ rules: what R does when you combine values of different data types.

- __vectorization__: when R applies calculations or operations to all the elements of a vector (element-wise).

- __recycling__: what R does when you perform a calculation with vectors of different length.

- __subsetting__ (aka indexing, subscripting, bracket notation)

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

At the end of this week you will be able to:

- List the four common data types in R, and give examples for them
- Explain why R vectors are said to be atomic objects
- Describe and give an example of the implicit coercion rules
- Describe and give an example of vectorized code
- Describe and give an example of the recycling rule
